Play with the demo at http://o2labs.github.io/handshake-html5-vibrate-haptic-library/

Currently, it works on 

- Firefox for Android
- Chrome (beta) for Android
- Firefox Mobile
- BlackBerry 10
 
Other browsers will come in time :-)

We encourage you to submit interesting and useful vibration patterns as pull requests.

The vibrate API works by defining how long the phone or tablet's vibration motor is on or off.

`navigator.vibrate([200, 100, 500]);` means vibrate for 200ms, pause for 100ms, vibrate for 500ms.
